## Course Overview

### Assessment

The course will be graded based on the following components:

- **Participation** (10%): You are expected to attend class, participate in the Canvas forum, and work in groups for Case Studies assignments and the Final Project.
- **Assignments** (50%): You will be assigned a computational assignment to be completed using RStudio and submitted with Jupyter Notebook regularly throughout the course.
- **Case Studies** (20%): You will be assigned applied case studies throughout the class that are to be completed using RStudio.
- **Final Project** (20%): The final project will be a computational case study that brings together the techniques learned throughout the semester. The description for this project will be provided towards the mid point of the semester.
- **Extra Credit** (+5%): Create a *well-organized* database of *all* R functions that you use throughout the semester. These include those mentioned in lectures, those introduced in homework, etc. Along with each function, give a brief description that details the use of the function. Also, organize these functions into categories according to their use.

Participation
- You are expected to attend each class session. That being said, unexpected events and technical difficulties are unavoidable. Please let me know when you are unable to attend. If absences are excessive please meet with me to discuss or this will affect your attendance score.
- The Canvas forum should be your first stop for questions about assignment problems (or anything about the material) for two reasons: (1) The answer to your question is likely valuable for the rest of the class and (2) your classmates might be able to answer your question more quickly than I can. There is no precise rule for how much you should post on Canvas, but you should post or answer a question at least a few times throughout the semester.
- There are six class sessions where you will complete or present case studies assignments in groups. You are expected to attend these six dates and must give prior notice if you are unable to do so.

Assignments
- All assignments must be submitted using Jupyter Notebook and by the designated due date. You are give *exactly one* 'no questions asked' one week extension on any assignment. This must be communicated prior to or on the due date of the particular assignment. Late assignments receive a 10% penalty for each day they are late. For example, if you turn in an assignment on February 5 that was due on February 2 and score a 90% on the assignment you will receive a score of 90 * (.7) = 63%.
- Students are encouraged to ask questions on Canvas and work with each other outside of class. However, all written answers and code for your assignment must be written by you, *NOT* copy and pasted from the internet or your classmate's work. On each assignment you must pledge that the work is your own and detail any outside help you received. Failure to do so and/or violating this pledge may result in an academic honesty violation.

Case Studies
- These are group assignments that are to be started in-class on three designated days of the semester (see below). All group members are given the same score, provided they all contribute a relatively equal amount to the assignment. You are expected to be an active, inclusive, and respectful group member and will be scored accordingly. Groups will turn in a single Jupyter Notebook file and present a portion of it to the rest of the class on the due date.

Final Project
- The final project has four major components: (1) forming a group with a clear topic by the specified dates, (2) a 15 minutes presentation of your project(with each group member participating), (3) an organized Jupyter notebook where all executable code can be found presented neatly, and (4) a GitHub repository containing your slides and Jupyter notebook.
