**Syllabus**: [Link](https://github.com/mgruddy/Intro_Data_ScienceR_Spring2021/blob/main/BSDS100_Spring21_Syllabus.pdf)

## Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to

- Proficiently wrangle, manipulate, and explore data using the R programming language
- Utilize contemporary R libraries including *ggplot2*, *tibble*, *tidyr*, *dplyr*, *knitr*, and *stringr*
- Visualize, present, and communicate trends in a variety of data types
- Communicate results using Jupyter Notebook

## Course Overview

### Assessment

The course will be graded based on the following components:

- **Participation** (10%): You are expected to attend class when possible, participate in the Canvas forum, and work in groups for Case Studies assignments and the Final Project. You are also expect to follow the Code of Conduct (below).
- **Assignments** (50%): You will be assigned a computational assignment to be submitted with Jupyter Notebook regularly throughout the course.
- **Case Studies** (20%): You will be assigned applied case studies throughout the class that are to be completed as a group.
- **Final Project** (20%): The final project will be a computational case study that brings together the techniques learned throughout the semester. The description for this project will be provided towards the mid point of the semester.

### Code of Conduct

As students will often be asked to share and discuss their work, and work on assignments with their peers, the code of conduct **MUST** be followed. Students are expected to be highly respectful of their peers during and outside of class to help foster an inclusive environment where everyone is comfortable making mistakes and contributing. When working as a group, it is every group member's responsibility to make sure everyone has input and understands the answers given.

### Recorded Lectures

Recorded lectures are available to enrolled students. If you are unable to attend the live lecture, you must submit a Lecture Reflection Form (found [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeJCWoDAdso9OJbMcQ7jRC3QZvakFfqTIBBxaW-DUqd4kNXWA/viewform?usp=sf_link)) to receive participation credit.
